		strong Defining the Problem and the Root Causes

	p Based on the feedback we received from our partners and their customers, I led brainstorming sessions with my product manager and a customer success associate to understand why order volume and revenue have remained stagnant across all our restaurant partners. I documented our observations throughout the ordering journey and connected the insights to kick off the ideation process for potential solutions.

	p From this list of issues, here is how we defined the main problem that we want to solve and what the root causes that we need to overcome in order to give our partners' customers satisfactory ordering journey, which in turn will increase the order volume and revenue of our partners.

		li Customers are dropping off without completing their orders, leading to a lower volume of orders for our restaurant partners and negatively impacting their revenue through our platform.
			ul
				li Customers get frustrated with the overall convoluted journey of finding and adding food to cart to checking out
				li It leads to confusion when they are redirected to a different page every time they click on something, losing their browsing position
				li They have a hard time understanding and managing what's in their cart due to lack of essential information

	h2
		strong Ideation

	p Now that we have a clear understanding of the factors preventing our end users from completing their orders, I began ideating solutions to address these challenges. My goal was to design the page so customers could easily browse the menu on a single page, minimizing unnecessary navigation steps. Additionally, I wanted to ensure they could manage their cart without losing their place in the menu. Through research and a thorough competitor analysis, I identified best practices and broke them down into specific elements of the journey to shape the customer experience.

	p I worked closely with my engineering manager and the rest of the engineering team to nail down the feasibility of these ideas, define the non-negotiables and meet halfway where we can. We want to solidify a proper list of functionalities that will for sure be doable before I even get to prototyping. Because of time crunch, we want to make sure that I only focus my time and energy on prototyping the features that will definitely make it to the actual product.

	p Based on our data, 36% of our partners' customers use their mobile devices to place orders, so I made sure to include mobile considerations for the platform, making sure the design accommodates a mobile-first approach, as well as slight modifications to controls and displays specifically for mobile viewports.
