				strong Errors hindering collaboration
			p A form was only accessible to one person at a given time and also does not have any collaboration features, failing to simulate a round table discussion virtually.

			p.text-primary.fs-5
				strong Lack of version control
			p Team members worked on the same copy of a form so inputs can be overwritten intentionally or unintentionally, without a way to revert or track changes.
