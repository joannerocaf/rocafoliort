			p Leaders and Instructors have the ability to easily create courses, set rules for prerequisites and privacy, upload thumbnails, video materials, and relevant attachments for each chapter. They can save drafts and continue editing later until they are ready to publish the course. Depending on user permission settings, Instructors may need to submit courses for approval before they can be published.
