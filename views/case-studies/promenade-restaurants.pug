			h2 Context/Background
			p
				| This project is a byproduct of the Restaurant-Managed Menus project.
				| We had to rebuild parts of the theme that were taken away when we replaced
				| certain plugins. However, we hypothesize that the improved user experience
				| and higher anticipated conversion rate may help increase sales, which is
				| Restaurants‚Äô largest initiative this year. We took the opportunity to
				| improve the customer shopping experience, which was clunky and outdated.
			p
				| The Promenade for Restaurants platform needs a refresh to better appeal to
				| prospective vendors. By revamping the website look & feel as well as
				| vendor-facing tools, we will be essentially relaunching all the visible
				| aspects of the platform to better position them for sales success.
			p
				| This redesign will tackle some of the pages at the storefront for better
				| usability, experience and tie-in with the new managed menu system.

			h2 Problems
			ol
				li
					strong Complex Navigation:&nbsp;
					| Users face a convoluted journey to find and add food items to their
					| cart, leading to frustration and a time-consuming experience.
				li
					strong Lost Browsing Position:&nbsp;
					| Unnecessary redirection to separate pages disrupts the user's menu
					| browsing position, causing confusion and hindering seamless navigation.
				li
					strong Confusing Cart Display:&nbsp;
					| The cart display suffers from unclear text hierarchy for variants and
					| customization lists, compounded by the absence of product photos,
					| resulting in a user-unfriendly experience.
				li
					strong Erroneous Pricing:&nbsp;
					| Multiple ways of customizing orders lead to inconsistent pricing
					| display, causing confusion and potentially affecting order accuracy.
				li
					strong Wasted Real Estate:&nbsp;
					| The website's layout wastes significant screen space, pushing important
					| information below the fold, impacting user engagement.
				li
					strong Inaccurate Breadcrumbs:&nbsp;
					| Breadcrumbs fail to provide accurate navigation, only leading users
					| back to the homepage rather than aiding in their journey through the
					| website.
